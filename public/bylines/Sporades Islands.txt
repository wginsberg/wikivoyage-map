The Sporades Islands (Greek: Βόρειες Σποράδες) have a quite different atmosphere from the travel-poster Greece of the Cyclades islands: instead of bare rugged hills topped with dazzling cubistic villages, the Sporades are fertile and heavily wooded, with pine-forested mountains sloping down to some of the best beaches in the Aegean, and the local architecture is more characteristic of Northern Greece, with less whitewashing and more stone roofs.
