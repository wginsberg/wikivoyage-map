Abbeville is a town in the Old 96 District that has the distinction of being where the Civil War was both instigated and terminated in a way, as it was here that a delegation of South Carolinians came together at "Secession Hill" on November 22, 1860 to decide to secede from the Union, and moreover where, at the Burt-Stark Mansion, a perhaps crestfallen Jefferson Davis moved to dissolve the Confederacy on May 2, 1865.
