Acadia (French: Acadie) is a historical term generally understood to comprise all of the land in Canada east of Quebec that was held by France in the 17th and early 18th centuries; that is to say, the modern-day Maritime Provinces as well as roughly the eastern two-thirds of the U.S. state of Maine, which is where you'll find Acadia National Park.
