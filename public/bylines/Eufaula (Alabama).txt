Eufaula is a town on the west bank of the Chattahoochee River in the River Heritage region of Alabama, and like that river, Eufaula is a real sleeper, though it has a dark restive past, with secessionists terrorizing abolitionists before the Civil War, and white supremacists killing at least 7 black individuals during the Election Riot of 1874, not to mention municipal officials postponing integration as much as possible.
