Haida Gwaii (Islands of the People), previously known as the Queen Charlotte Islands, and before that as "Xhaaidlagha Gwaayaai" or â€œIslands at the Boundary of the World," are in British Columbia, Canada. Though the archipelago comprises over 150 islands, the two largest, Graham and Moresby, dominate the visitor's itinerary.
