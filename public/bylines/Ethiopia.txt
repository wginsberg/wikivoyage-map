Travelers to Ethiopia (Amharic: ኢትዮጵያ ʾĪtyōp yā) experience a country divided into two: in the north and east the focus is on cultural heritage, while in the south there are several national parks and lakes in the area of the East African Rift with their flora and fauna as well as the habitat of several indigenous peoples.
