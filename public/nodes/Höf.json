{"Höfn":{"title":"Höfn","lat":64.25,"lng":-15.2,"byline":"Höfn (pronounced something like \"herpn\", also known as Höfn í Hornafirði, is a town in East Iceland, at the south-eastern corner of the country. Höfn sits by the lagoon (or fjord) Hornafjörður which is also the name of the large municipality of which the town is the centre and which covers the entire area of the county Austur-Skaftafellssýsla. This guide covers the town and the surrounding municipality, excluding the westernmost part which forms one of the main gateways to Vatnajökull National Park. For tourism purposes, the area calls itself the Vatnajökull Region: nowhere else is quite as dominated by Europe's largest glacier, nowhere else have people learned to live in such close quarters with the huge sheet of ice.","edges":["East Iceland","Egilsstaðir","South Iceland","Kirkjubæjarklaustur","Interior (Iceland)"]}}
